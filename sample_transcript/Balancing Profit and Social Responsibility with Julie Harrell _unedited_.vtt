Welcome back to the show.

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:22.751
I'm Steven Sikash, joined by my co-host,

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.693
Mike Liske, and our special guest today.

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:27.794
Before we start, a little bit of news.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:28.394
This morning,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:29.675
our AI Chief Marketing

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.077
Officer Platform at

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:33.578
AICMO.io won gold medal

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:35.659
from the Merit Awards for Marketing,

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.180

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:37.701
and Innovation.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.703
And I heard a few minutes ago,

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:40.662
we're also featured in

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:41.584
Performance Marketing

00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:43.784
World's Top Tools of this week.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:45.725
So fun way to kick off the day.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.226
If you are a small business

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.588
or run a small marketing team,

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:52.090
check it out at AICMO.io.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.950
We're really willing to help

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.970
you market with purpose.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.732
And that gets us to the show today.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:00:59.314
We're speaking with a leader

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:00.374
who proves that even the

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:01.814
most unexpected industries

00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:03.356
can create real impact,

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:04.716
not just for their customers,

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:06.498
but for their communities and teams.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:07.888
And we have a lot of

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.189
franchises that have been

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:10.531
around for many years,

00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:11.513
and we wanted to dive in

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.813
with some that are in the

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.137
early stages of the journey.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:18.159
And that's the case today.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.081
So Mike, introduce our guest today.

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:22.706
I'd absolutely love to, Stephen.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.246
Looking forward to the conversation.

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:27.349
So today our special guest

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:29.209
is Julie Harrell,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.990
the president of Cooper Scoopers.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:34.052
It's a pet waste removal

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:36.013
company with an unwavering

00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:38.655
focus on dignity, service,

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.697
and making sure that there's social good.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:42.257
So Julia,

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:45.659
has taken what some might

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.459
see as a basic service and

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.320
transformed it into really

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.460
a mission driven enterprise

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:53.941
from employing and

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.143
uplifting team members to

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:58.463
upbuilding a business that

00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:00.625
people are proud of to be a part of.

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:03.385
She's redefining what it

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:05.826
means really to lead with heart,

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:07.906
which we know we really

00:02:07.947 --> 00:02:09.828
love to talk about here on the show.

00:02:09.888 --> 00:02:12.149
So Julie, welcome to our show today.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:14.384
Thank you.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:15.746
Super excited to be here.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:15.806
Oh,

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.467
and we are super excited for this

00:02:17.508 --> 00:02:18.329
conversation.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.091
Um, maybe just to be, you know,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.832
start us off on, um, a lighter note.

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:24.212
Yeah.

00:02:24.253 --> 00:02:26.074
What inspired you to turn a

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:29.277
scooping business, uh, into a platform,

00:02:29.298 --> 00:02:31.740
uh, you know, that, that is benefiting,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.419
you know,

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.921
making a social impact and

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:35.502
benefiting communities.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:37.028
Yeah,

00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:38.669
so I actually took on this

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.189
opportunity back in December.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.870
So the concept of Cooper

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.070
Scoopers was created last summer,

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:46.890
and it was an incredible,

00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.211
very heartwarming story.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.391
So our founder was spending

00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:51.472
time with her grandparents,

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.332
and they had a little fluffy dog,

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:55.932
obviously providing them a

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:58.492
lot of companionship in their older age,

00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:00.753
maybe not going out as much,

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:02.133
maybe not seeing people as often,

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:04.175
but always having that wet

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:05.995
nose to snuggle with.

00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:08.193
But also seeing the

00:03:08.213 --> 00:03:09.995
challenges when it comes to

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:11.616
being able to have a clean,

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:13.877
safe backyard for that pet.

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:15.299
And also, you know,

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:16.979
grandchildren come over to run around.

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:19.622
So I saw a real need there

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:22.283
for being able to enjoy

00:03:22.324 --> 00:03:23.805
that companionship without

00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:25.385
the dirty work that comes in it.

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:27.087
So I was really excited to

00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:28.207
take on this opportunity

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:30.590
back in December for Cooper

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.890
Scoopers as the president.

00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:33.722
And again,

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:35.503
we may be in the pet waste business,

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:36.765
but at our core,

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:38.227
we're about dignity

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:40.308
opportunities for our

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:42.572
franchisees and also making

00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.693
sure that we are creating a clean,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:46.256
safe environment for

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:49.199
residential and commercial customers.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.538
Hmm.

00:03:51.602 --> 00:03:52.582
you know that that wet nose

00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:53.562
comment just reminded me

00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:54.984
how I woke up this morning

00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:56.685
I had my little eight pound

00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:59.145
uh maltese just kind of

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:00.687
jump on my chest and poke

00:04:00.727 --> 00:04:02.888
me it's time to get up time

00:04:02.907 --> 00:04:05.109
to go outside um julie uh

00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:06.509
many people kind of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.729
underestimate industries

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.131
like yours in a lot of ways

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.491
yet I think what's unique

00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:13.193
is you can find ways to

00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:15.234
touch people in very real

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:16.975
consistent ways right um

00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:20.023
How has purpose shifted the

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:22.983
perception of your business internally,

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:23.584
externally?

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:25.064
Yeah.

00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:25.884
So the biggest thing is

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:27.425
making sure that we are

00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:29.305
sending in Cooper certified

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:32.406
technicians for all of our customers.

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:33.648
We want to make sure not

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:37.528
only that the backyard is safe and clean,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.949
but we want to make sure

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.790
that our customers know

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.951
who's entering their backyards.

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:45.117
know who is potentially, you know,

00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:46.338
the biggest thing for us is

00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:47.459
making sure that we're

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.401
going above and beyond in that service.

00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:51.262
So they know who's coming,

00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:53.043
they know what services they're getting.

00:04:53.704 --> 00:04:55.064
And then our technicians go

00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:56.766
above and beyond on making sure that,

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:59.488
you know, the gates close, that, you know,

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:00.288
there's nothing in the

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.091
backyard that's going to harm the pet.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.252
So really doing that with our branding,

00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:05.112
making sure that our

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:06.153
technicians are fully

00:05:06.194 --> 00:05:08.315
branded as they're entering any property.

00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:11.470
And sharing that story as well,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.892
the founder's story with

00:05:12.952 --> 00:05:14.136
all of our customers.

00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:16.456
You know, that also,

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:19.077
I just went on a trip and

00:05:19.197 --> 00:05:20.057
as I'm in the airport,

00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:21.619
I heard we had five

00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:23.019
rattlesnakes in our backyard.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.122
I know.

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:25.641
And I'm like,

00:05:26.262 --> 00:05:27.362
my mom's watching the house

00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:28.824
and I'm thinking like, okay, I've got,

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:29.404
you know,

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:30.605
the elderly person and the very

00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:31.225
small dog.

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:31.646
And I'm like,

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:33.807
you can't go into the backyard right now.

00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:35.007
I'm going to have to send someone over,

00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:36.670
but there are really very real.

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.290
I mean, that's very real,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.091
but very real concerns too, with,

00:05:40.192 --> 00:05:41.512
you know, taking care of

00:05:42.435 --> 00:05:44.096
pet and providing that safe

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:45.437
environment back there.

00:05:46.377 --> 00:05:48.079
That sometimes, you know, we just,

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.420
like you said,

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.319
you don't want anyone just

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.120
going in the backyard and, you know,

00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.242
leaving a gate open or

00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:53.401
something like that.

00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:53.603
Right.

00:05:53.663 --> 00:05:55.723
I mean, there's dangers to, you know,

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:57.685
a broken fence post, right?

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.565
That's something that our technicians,

00:05:59.646 --> 00:05:59.865
again,

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:01.166
will go above and beyond to make

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:02.387
sure that that pet's safe.

00:06:03.048 --> 00:06:03.767
They're also going to look

00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:06.189
at potential changes in the pet's diet.

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.810
That, you know,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.211
I don't know if anyone has

00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:10.372
had a vet visit.

00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:12.002
with a dog that's

00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:13.624
potentially swallowed a sock,

00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:15.343
but that's very dangerous

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:16.564
and very expensive.

00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:18.305
So we wanna make sure that

00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:20.225
our pet parents know that

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:21.125
we are always gonna go

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:22.786
above and beyond when it

00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:26.408
comes to the care of their pets.

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:29.088
Yeah, but going beyond the service, right?

00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:31.329
It's almost providing

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:34.790
looking after the wellbeing of the pet,

00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:35.190
right?

00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:36.331
Absolutely.

00:06:37.134 --> 00:06:39.139
a great concept so julie um

00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:39.822
one of the things you're

00:06:39.843 --> 00:06:42.771
fostering engagement uh and connections

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:44.079
you know,

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.800
we understand is absolutely critical,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.100
right?

00:06:48.622 --> 00:06:50.324
And we love to discuss that

00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:51.884
oftentimes on this show.

00:06:51.904 --> 00:06:52.584
And in fact,

00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:54.687
there was a report that was

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:58.889
recently done by PwC and

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.230
eighty nine percent of the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.432
executives that were

00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:03.293
interviewed in this report

00:07:03.353 --> 00:07:07.096
were saying that a purpose driven company

00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:12.833
delivers a better employee experience,

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:14.975
higher employee satisfaction,

00:07:15.574 --> 00:07:18.596
and better retention of their employees.

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:22.778
So, I mean, that stat just speaks volumes,

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:22.999
right?

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:24.160
When there's eighty-nine

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.461
percent of those leaders

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.002
out there that are saying that.

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:30.142
So, and yourself, right?

00:07:30.163 --> 00:07:31.684
You've built a team,

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:34.625
a culture that not only performs,

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:37.007
but it sounds like from

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:37.747
what you're saying,

00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:39.709
They really feel connected

00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:41.470
with the families that they're serving,

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.670
with the pets that they're serving.

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:44.550
So how do you, though,

00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:46.072
foster that kind of

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.814
engagement and the loyalty?

00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:50.994
So that really starts with

00:07:51.093 --> 00:07:52.134
just seeing people where

00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:53.516
they are and treating them,

00:07:53.675 --> 00:07:55.437
treating every role as essential.

00:07:55.677 --> 00:07:55.976
Right.

00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:58.358
So even myself, our franchise owners,

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.918
our technicians,

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:01.158
anyone who is under the

00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:02.379
Cooper Scoopers umbrella.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.130
making sure that they know

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.872
how essential they are and

00:08:05.913 --> 00:08:07.574
giving them the tools to be

00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:08.314
able to do that.

00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:09.314
Also,

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.857
we really big on celebrating all of

00:08:11.877 --> 00:08:13.358
our wins, big and small.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:15.319
So, again, as we're starting,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.442
we are a very brand new business.

00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:19.543
So it's really important to

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:21.904
celebrate whatever step we're at.

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:23.947
We also give our franchisees

00:08:23.987 --> 00:08:25.148
a lot of ownership within

00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:26.348
their business and

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:28.750
communicating all of the time.

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:31.266
from a corporate stance down

00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:32.488
to our customers, again,

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:33.649
going above and beyond.

00:08:34.528 --> 00:08:35.750
We want to make sure people

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.890
feel seen and heard.

00:08:37.652 --> 00:08:39.592
And when they're respected, seen, heard,

00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:41.173
they want to stick around.

00:08:41.474 --> 00:08:43.154
They have more value in their job.

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:44.135
And then that's also

00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:44.956
bringing incredible

00:08:45.015 --> 00:08:46.336
customer retention because

00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:47.518
it's a trickle-down effect.

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:49.198
So we're hoping to duplicate

00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:50.340
that across the nation as

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.160
we continue to grow Cooper Scoopers.

00:08:53.904 --> 00:08:55.927
Well, and you're well on your way,

00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:56.767
it sounds like.

00:08:57.408 --> 00:09:00.931
I love your comment there because we,

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:02.432
as well on the show,

00:09:02.471 --> 00:09:03.692
discuss a lot of the

00:09:03.732 --> 00:09:06.375
conscious capitalism principles.

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:08.017
And one of the key

00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:09.697
principles there is looking

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:11.700
after or keeping in mind

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:13.701
all of the stakeholders.

00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:15.783
And as you were sort of articulating there,

00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:17.063
right, there's the employee,

00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:18.826
there's the family, there's the pet.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:23.950
There's yourself, for example,

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.110
the franchisee.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.432
So it sounds like everybody

00:09:27.993 --> 00:09:29.474
there at Cooper Scoopers is

00:09:29.553 --> 00:09:30.855
really being considered

00:09:30.894 --> 00:09:34.977
then in the activities of

00:09:34.998 --> 00:09:35.837
the organization.

00:09:35.857 --> 00:09:40.121
Very important.

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:41.001
So you're kind of in this

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.403
early stage of growth.

00:09:43.443 --> 00:09:44.125
I think you said you opened

00:09:44.144 --> 00:09:47.086
your first franchise in February.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.052
Um, you're now up to seven locations.

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:54.714
Um, one thing that in these early stages,

00:09:54.754 --> 00:09:55.354
that is,

00:09:56.274 --> 00:09:57.414
I guess it's maybe a little bit

00:09:57.475 --> 00:09:58.434
easier in the early stage

00:09:58.475 --> 00:09:59.635
to maintain kind of that,

00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:03.517
that culture and that, you know, level of,

00:10:03.716 --> 00:10:03.956
you know,

00:10:03.996 --> 00:10:07.298
intentional hiring and things like that.

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:09.519
Um, how, how are you,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.539
how are you going to make

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.120
sure you maintain that as you grow?

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.821
And, you know,

00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:13.760
the stuff that's important

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.741
to you doesn't get, uh, you know, kind of

00:10:16.676 --> 00:10:17.895
washed away by a system or

00:10:17.936 --> 00:10:19.297
something like that?

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:20.076
Yeah,

00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:23.697
so our mission and value for our

00:10:23.738 --> 00:10:25.219
parent company, Loyalty Brands,

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:27.259
is having fun and improving lives.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.200
And we also have additional

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.321
missions and values for Coopers Scoopers.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.280
So we have to make sure that

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.221
not only the people that

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.182
we're bringing on now,

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.081
but the people that we're

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:37.361
bringing on in six months,

00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:38.283
a year from now,

00:10:39.523 --> 00:10:41.163
believe in those missions

00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:42.104
and those values,

00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:44.284
truly our values of giving back,

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:45.644
creating a clean space,

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.051
All of us want to be a part of something.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.412
We want to be a part of

00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:50.533
something bigger than us.

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:52.114
So being able to educate the

00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:54.215
population on the toxicity

00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:55.316
that's lingering in their

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:57.738
backyard or running down

00:10:57.798 --> 00:10:58.918
into their waterways.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.802
But that hits home specifically for myself,

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:04.543
located in the Tidewater

00:11:04.644 --> 00:11:06.504
area of Virginia Beach, Virginia.

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:09.047
So making sure that we are

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:10.447
staying true to those

00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:12.830
values of keeping our world

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:13.890
clean and safe.

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:16.054
As we continue to grow.

00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:18.775
Saw this awesome quote from

00:11:18.836 --> 00:11:19.876
a podcast that I was

00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:21.076
listening to last week.

00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:23.778
Growth doesn't mean letting go of purpose.

00:11:23.818 --> 00:11:25.179
It means spreading it wider.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.041
So we have to make sure that

00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:28.660
we are constantly staying

00:11:28.701 --> 00:11:31.123
true to our values and the

00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:33.443
purpose of why we are in this business.

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:35.011
Yeah,

00:11:35.052 --> 00:11:38.393
I think our guest on Tuesdays said

00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:39.293
sometimes you want to put

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:40.852
the cult in culture when

00:11:40.873 --> 00:11:42.974
we're talking about it.

00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:44.333
Because really,

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:46.153
you don't want that as

00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:47.855
things trickle down just to get diluted,

00:11:47.894 --> 00:11:48.154
right?

00:11:48.634 --> 00:11:50.455
You really want to make sure

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:54.535
that purpose is repeated continually.

00:11:54.816 --> 00:11:56.976
When you're hiring someone new,

00:11:57.017 --> 00:11:59.636
as a franchisee,

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:00.717
are there any specific

00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:02.857
traits you're looking for in that person?

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:04.341
Yeah, I mean,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.062
somebody who really has a growth mindset.

00:12:06.783 --> 00:12:07.864
This business has the

00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:09.884
opportunity for multiple

00:12:09.924 --> 00:12:11.287
trucks within a territory.

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:13.548
Somebody who really does

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:14.750
want to give back.

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:17.172
Somebody who has a concern

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:18.072
for public health,

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.674
wants to make sure that the

00:12:20.715 --> 00:12:21.635
world's going to be a safe

00:12:21.676 --> 00:12:22.876
place for their children

00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:23.778
and grandchildren.

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.600
And somebody who really

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.142
shows up with respect and

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:30.984
kindness in any capacity.

00:12:31.892 --> 00:12:33.693
You know, we are picking up poop,

00:12:33.734 --> 00:12:35.056
but it is much more than that.

00:12:35.336 --> 00:12:36.298
So we want to make sure that

00:12:36.337 --> 00:12:40.202
someone has that ability to

00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:42.065
connect with their

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:44.828
community for many different aspects,

00:12:44.908 --> 00:12:46.831
not only cleaning up the pet

00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:48.923
Yeah.

00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:51.004
So, Julie, I could actually,

00:12:51.024 --> 00:12:52.365
when you're responding and

00:12:52.384 --> 00:12:53.164
you're saying that we all

00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:55.287
want to be a part of

00:12:55.326 --> 00:12:56.707
something bigger than ourselves,

00:12:57.107 --> 00:12:58.067
I could see Tulio,

00:12:58.087 --> 00:12:59.668
our executive producer in the back,

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:01.110
just going like, yes,

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:03.731
because it's so true.

00:13:04.572 --> 00:13:05.413
Question for you about the

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:07.955
franchisees that you're

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:08.835
looking to attract.

00:13:09.514 --> 00:13:11.736
Similar question to what Steve asked you.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.158
What sort of traits do you

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:16.000
look for in them?

00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.063
What sort of individuals are

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.809
you trying to attract to Cooper Scoopers?

00:13:20.903 --> 00:13:21.102
Yeah,

00:13:21.163 --> 00:13:22.744
so somebody who is willing to follow

00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:23.504
the system, right?

00:13:23.543 --> 00:13:24.804
You definitely join a

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.725
franchise because you want

00:13:26.745 --> 00:13:27.725
the playbook there.

00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:30.366
So you have to have a

00:13:30.407 --> 00:13:31.567
mindset to follow our

00:13:31.606 --> 00:13:32.927
system that we provide to you.

00:13:33.227 --> 00:13:33.908
You also want to make sure

00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:34.548
that you do have an

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:35.808
entrepreneurial mindset.

00:13:36.288 --> 00:13:37.710
This is your business, right?

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.409
You're buying into the brand

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.750
and the systems.

00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:41.730
But at the end of the day,

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.711
this is your business.

00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:44.251
So you do have to be able to execute.

00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:46.653
So those are definite traits

00:13:46.673 --> 00:13:48.173
that we want our franchisees to have.

00:13:48.844 --> 00:13:50.105
And again, that team spirit,

00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:52.546
that is the most incredible

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:53.645
thing about joining Cooper

00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:55.547
Scoopers is the community

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:56.606
that you have around you.

00:13:56.986 --> 00:13:58.187
We are growing in certain

00:13:58.227 --> 00:13:59.868
territories quicker than others,

00:14:00.288 --> 00:14:02.668
but you have a best friend

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:04.149
right next to you that you can text.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.850
We have our internal communications.

00:14:07.673 --> 00:14:08.854
that is going to support you

00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:09.514
throughout the way.

00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:12.035
So being able to work in a team setting,

00:14:12.256 --> 00:14:13.918
even though you may be in

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:15.058
your own little territory,

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:17.179
is very important for the

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.260
growth and the success of

00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:20.001
our franchisees.

00:14:20.022 --> 00:14:23.024
With this stage of your franchise building,

00:14:23.043 --> 00:14:23.965
what kind of things are you

00:14:24.004 --> 00:14:25.046
particularly focused on?

00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:26.346
Yeah,

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.629
so a lot of our systems and processes

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.490
have to work for multiple

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.152
trucks within a territory

00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:34.293
for a franchise owner.

00:14:35.092 --> 00:14:36.214
And as, again,

00:14:36.873 --> 00:14:37.693
rapid growth.

00:14:38.173 --> 00:14:38.754
In two months,

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:40.336
we're up to seven territories.

00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:43.057
So we have very big goals at

00:14:43.097 --> 00:14:44.238
Cooper Scoopers to make

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:47.520
sure that there are multiple trucks, many,

00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:49.081
many trucks across the nation.

00:14:49.662 --> 00:14:50.743
So making sure that the

00:14:50.783 --> 00:14:52.323
systems and processes that

00:14:52.344 --> 00:14:53.384
we are implementing work

00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:54.806
now and then a year from now.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.191
We also want to make sure

00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:57.490
that our franchisees are

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.613
going to be fanatical fans

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:00.894
of Coopers Scoopers.

00:15:01.894 --> 00:15:03.895
It all starts with a conversation.

00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:04.836
So we want to make sure that

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.557
they are fans of the

00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:07.298
business that they're

00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:08.639
running and they have the

00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:09.799
confidence to share about

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.740
Coopers Scoopers with everyone.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.721
Yeah,

00:15:13.822 --> 00:15:15.583
I can see that being that fanatical

00:15:15.604 --> 00:15:17.424
fan being a big difference

00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:18.085
maker for them.

00:15:19.326 --> 00:15:20.486
You know, people feel that, I think.

00:15:21.327 --> 00:15:21.807
Absolutely.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:23.308
Yeah,

00:15:23.328 --> 00:15:25.730
it certainly brings zeal to the work

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.129
that you do.

00:15:26.169 --> 00:15:26.990
So Julie,

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:27.789
bringing it back to the

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.130
conversation around values.

00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:30.951
So you're related to this

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.591
topic of values and

00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:35.812
obviously values are at

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:36.932
times just sort of thrown

00:15:36.972 --> 00:15:38.732
around as things that

00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:40.754
companies have to have.

00:15:41.653 --> 00:15:42.533
You could say maybe some

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:44.335
just think of them as like table stakes.

00:15:45.134 --> 00:15:46.975
But there was a report out

00:15:47.015 --> 00:15:48.496
that was stating that

00:15:48.557 --> 00:15:49.677
seventy two percent of the

00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:51.239
consumers say that they're

00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:54.081
more likely to be loyal to

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.443
a company that aligns with their values.

00:15:57.703 --> 00:16:00.405
And that report was done by Kohn,

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:01.566
Porter and Novelli.

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:03.147
And that's a huge

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:05.308
opportunity right then for a business.

00:16:06.871 --> 00:16:07.971
to really try to identify

00:16:08.011 --> 00:16:09.273
those customers and align

00:16:09.893 --> 00:16:12.312
with those that connect with them, right?

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:14.634
So how do you communicate, I guess,

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.173
your values to customers

00:16:16.234 --> 00:16:18.394
and make sure that they're

00:16:18.514 --> 00:16:20.294
known and that it isn't

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:22.275
just the service that you're providing,

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.535
but really in a way, this is,

00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:25.196
like you said,

00:16:25.716 --> 00:16:28.496
something bigger than the service.

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:29.096
Yeah,

00:16:29.136 --> 00:16:31.057
so that starts with our initial

00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:32.857
conversation with any of our customers,

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:33.118
right?

00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:33.957
We want to make sure that

00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:36.239
they are very aware of all of the value

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:39.408
that we bring and the value

00:16:39.427 --> 00:16:40.089
that we bring to the

00:16:40.109 --> 00:16:41.809
service is a direct

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:43.010
response to the values that

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.951
we have as a company.

00:16:45.011 --> 00:16:45.972
And that's another question.

00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:47.634
So to turn that back around,

00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:48.914
to make sure that those

00:16:48.934 --> 00:16:50.777
values trickle down to our customers,

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.518
we want to understand,

00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:54.038
we want our franchisees,

00:16:54.178 --> 00:16:55.360
when they're joining our team,

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.981
we want them to share their

00:16:57.001 --> 00:16:57.922
values out loud.

00:16:58.363 --> 00:17:00.443
I think that's something sometimes we can

00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:03.984
kind of sit in our heads and say, oh, yeah,

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:04.824
this is my value.

00:17:04.844 --> 00:17:06.404
But how often do we actually

00:17:06.444 --> 00:17:07.905
speak truth to those words?

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.346
So I think that's really

00:17:09.365 --> 00:17:10.227
important for our

00:17:10.287 --> 00:17:12.387
franchisees as they're

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.009
joining our team to share those out loud.

00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:16.589
Make sure that they align

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.150
with their goals in their life as well.

00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:19.010
Right.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.951
We all have personal professional goals.

00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:23.032
So making sure that they align.

00:17:23.673 --> 00:17:24.292
And then again,

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:26.733
we're all on the same page.

00:17:26.773 --> 00:17:28.234
We're all moving in the same direction,

00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:30.175
values, mission and again, growth.

00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:35.538
So making sure that trickles

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:36.179
down to all of our customers.

00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:36.318
Gotcha.

00:17:36.338 --> 00:17:38.000
And then sort of maybe, oh, go ahead,

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:38.279
Steve.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.500
I didn't say anything.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.000
Go for it, Michael.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.161
Oh,

00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:42.282
I thought you were going to jump in

00:17:42.303 --> 00:17:42.923
there.

00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:45.223
Super important, right?

00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:46.986
I love to hear that being

00:17:47.026 --> 00:17:48.405
able to live those values

00:17:48.487 --> 00:17:49.346
rather than something that

00:17:49.386 --> 00:17:54.269
just lives on a wall somewhere.

00:17:55.211 --> 00:17:55.590
What's that?

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.752
An inspirational cat poster.

00:17:58.833 --> 00:17:59.834
Yep, exactly.

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:02.826
Maybe transitioning the

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:04.467
conversation down next to

00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:07.969
the topics of profit, responsibility,

00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:09.130
legacy.

00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:14.032
There's this idea of purpose

00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:16.013
again that comes.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.994
And there's one thing that I

00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:19.496
love to ask all of our

00:18:19.736 --> 00:18:21.436
guests that come here on the show.

00:18:22.377 --> 00:18:24.118
What role do you think or

00:18:24.138 --> 00:18:25.920
what would you say that a

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.820
well-defined purpose plays

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.862
in the success of a business?

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:32.185
Yeah.

00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:33.467
So, I mean, again,

00:18:33.507 --> 00:18:35.769
going back to even the most

00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:36.869
overlooked jobs,

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.691
making sure we're doing that with pride.

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.452
Again, having that purpose and heart.

00:18:43.194 --> 00:18:44.115
At the end of the day,

00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:46.257
we are not just picking up pet waste.

00:18:46.657 --> 00:18:48.378
We are providing clean space.

00:18:48.439 --> 00:18:50.520
We are giving back to the planet.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.801
And so, you know,

00:18:53.343 --> 00:18:54.564
really focusing on that

00:18:54.604 --> 00:18:56.025
throughout all of every

00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:57.385
single service that we complete.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:03.267
Oh, do we lose Julie?

00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:03.827
Oh, there she is.

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:07.269
Yeah, I love how you were saying earlier,

00:19:07.288 --> 00:19:09.529
you know, in terms of like safe and clean,

00:19:09.611 --> 00:19:11.872
doing no, you know, no harm to the pet.

00:19:11.912 --> 00:19:14.813
And I mean, really looking after, you know,

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:18.434
the overall health of, you know,

00:19:18.474 --> 00:19:20.135
someone's family member, really,

00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:22.237
at the end of the day, right,

00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:23.076
when we think about it.

00:19:24.078 --> 00:19:24.618
Absolutely.

00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:26.539
We're seeing an incredible

00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:28.880
increase in pet ownership.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.861
So over seventy percent of

00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:34.541
households own a pet and

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:36.041
over fifty percent of those

00:19:36.082 --> 00:19:37.762
households own a dog.

00:19:38.482 --> 00:19:40.163
So it's and we're not slowing down.

00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:40.403
Right.

00:19:40.423 --> 00:19:41.324
We're getting busier,

00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:44.325
busier and busier as I'm a

00:19:44.345 --> 00:19:45.365
working mom of two.

00:19:46.025 --> 00:19:47.826
My plate is overflowing.

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:50.346
So an incredible service to offer.

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:50.905
But again,

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:52.267
that purpose is going to keep us

00:19:52.287 --> 00:19:52.686
grounded.

00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:56.979
be our North Star to make sure that,

00:19:57.078 --> 00:19:57.819
you know,

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:01.261
we are we're just going above

00:20:01.321 --> 00:20:04.164
and beyond when it comes to the service,

00:20:04.884 --> 00:20:05.945
increasing our customer

00:20:05.986 --> 00:20:08.327
retention and again,

00:20:08.888 --> 00:20:09.788
inviting people to be a

00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:11.810
part of something that truly matters.

00:20:12.951 --> 00:20:14.393
You are definitely very busy.

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:16.295
I can only imagine as a president,

00:20:16.335 --> 00:20:16.515
you know,

00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:17.935
on top of like wanting to help

00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.436
do some of the marketing as

00:20:19.477 --> 00:20:20.278
you're doing right now,

00:20:20.867 --> 00:20:21.087
Uh,

00:20:21.107 --> 00:20:22.388
looking after all of the other

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.651
components of the business.

00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:25.873
So I can imagine you're a very busy lady.

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:29.536
You know, uh, Julie, so some leaders,

00:20:29.556 --> 00:20:31.518
they kind of see profit and

00:20:32.118 --> 00:20:33.259
social responsibility as

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:35.321
kind of these maybe opposing forces.

00:20:35.682 --> 00:20:38.444
Um, but your, you know,

00:20:38.464 --> 00:20:39.806
story in this conversation, obviously,

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.468
you know, it's kind of shows otherwise,

00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:43.209
how do you think businesses

00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:46.011
can pursue both, you know, without

00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:48.032
compromising either?

00:20:48.173 --> 00:20:49.374
Or do you have any tips for

00:20:49.413 --> 00:20:52.515
business owners trying to pursue both?

00:20:52.615 --> 00:20:53.476
It's communication,

00:20:53.675 --> 00:20:56.057
over communicating with your franchisees.

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:58.519
Really, as you know, you are a leader,

00:20:58.538 --> 00:20:59.940
so you truly can't have you

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.800
can't be in the in the passenger seat of,

00:21:03.422 --> 00:21:04.321
you know,

00:21:05.022 --> 00:21:07.903
a business of a franchisees truck.

00:21:07.943 --> 00:21:08.845
Right.

00:21:08.865 --> 00:21:10.165
But really communicating

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:14.167
what the goals are over

00:21:14.288 --> 00:21:15.648
communicating our purpose.

00:21:15.868 --> 00:21:16.088
Right.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.303
And then making sure that

00:21:18.323 --> 00:21:20.743
you're giving clear goals,

00:21:20.943 --> 00:21:22.663
KPIs for your franchisees

00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:25.986
and see what their focus is.

00:21:26.145 --> 00:21:27.205
I've been in the franchise

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:29.646
industry for almost five years now.

00:21:29.707 --> 00:21:30.707
So that's the biggest thing.

00:21:30.787 --> 00:21:32.928
Franchisees, again,

00:21:32.968 --> 00:21:34.009
not following the system

00:21:34.068 --> 00:21:35.949
can focus on the wrong area.

00:21:36.569 --> 00:21:37.509
So just constantly

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:39.411
communicating with them to

00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:41.531
make sure that their heart

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:43.531
is in it and that their

00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.093
mind is focused on the right thing.

00:21:46.863 --> 00:21:47.604
And to communicate with them,

00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:49.345
are you using what kind of

00:21:49.365 --> 00:21:50.205
systems or what are you

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.548
guys set up for that at this stage?

00:21:52.567 --> 00:21:53.890
Well, since we are a startup,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.471
we communicate almost daily.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.511
I was going to say,

00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:58.574
probably at this early stage, right,

00:21:58.594 --> 00:21:59.233
the communication is

00:21:59.253 --> 00:21:59.934
probably a lot more

00:21:59.994 --> 00:22:01.997
hands-on than if you've got

00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:02.938
like a hundred and fifty

00:22:02.978 --> 00:22:04.298
locations or something, right?

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:05.359
Absolutely.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.241
But I'm also taking into

00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:09.284
account that growth, right?

00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.125
I want to make sure that the

00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:12.807
communication cadence

00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:15.461
is structured in a way and

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.421
the tools that we use is

00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:18.280
structured in a way that is going to,

00:22:18.942 --> 00:22:19.201
again,

00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:20.622
create those touch points for our

00:22:20.682 --> 00:22:22.482
franchisees at seven and

00:22:22.522 --> 00:22:23.542
then at a hundred and fifty.

00:22:23.563 --> 00:22:25.042
Yeah,

00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:26.564
you have to kind of consider both

00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:27.203
those things.

00:22:28.523 --> 00:22:30.464
And making sure that we're creating that,

00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:30.984
again,

00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:32.265
that teamwork that I talked about

00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:32.746
earlier.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.705
You have somebody right next to you.

00:22:35.846 --> 00:22:37.626
So make sure that you are

00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:39.227
utilizing every resource

00:22:39.247 --> 00:22:41.107
that is provided because you are

00:22:42.393 --> 00:22:43.472
a part of this incredible

00:22:43.492 --> 00:22:45.414
brand and the support system.

00:22:47.656 --> 00:22:48.076
All right.

00:22:48.136 --> 00:22:50.239
We've got a question from

00:22:50.278 --> 00:22:51.078
the audience here.

00:22:51.199 --> 00:22:51.499
Julie,

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:53.020
if you could fast forward five years,

00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:54.662
what's the dream scenario

00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:55.762
for Cooper Scoopers?

00:22:55.782 --> 00:22:57.943
Love that.

00:22:57.983 --> 00:23:02.288
So innovative disposal tactics, right?

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:04.528
Question.

00:23:04.869 --> 00:23:05.931
How much waste does the

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.833
average dog produce in a year?

00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:10.513
Average dog, so say,

00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:14.675
That's like four of my dogs.

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:18.940
So I can, I mean,

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:20.922
I purposely kind of don't

00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:23.163
want a bigger dog because of all the,

00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:24.345
you know, um,

00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:25.766
exactly what you're talking about.

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:28.127
Um, what's, what's the answer?

00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:30.009
Pounds.

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:31.790
Pounds.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.251
Two seventy five.

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:33.813
Wow.

00:23:34.411 --> 00:23:36.011
So that's one dog, a lot of waste.

00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:38.451
So making sure that we are, again,

00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:40.413
being very mindful of our

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.114
environment and creating

00:23:42.173 --> 00:23:44.253
innovative ways to dispose of our waste.

00:23:44.954 --> 00:23:46.815
So that and seeing three

00:23:46.855 --> 00:23:48.615
thousand trucks on the road

00:23:48.715 --> 00:23:50.336
across the nation of Cooper

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:51.916
Scoopers franchisees.

00:23:54.028 --> 00:23:54.167
Yeah,

00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:56.068
that's and my neighbor's got three

00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:57.190
big dogs.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.151
So probably even twenty

00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:01.311
pounds bigger than that.

00:24:01.352 --> 00:24:03.573
So I can you know, this is like half a ton,

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:07.335
I think, is what the math is.

00:24:07.935 --> 00:24:13.479
Yes, I know they need a lifetime.

00:24:13.499 --> 00:24:13.699
Julie,

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:16.160
I was really happy to hear you talk

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.580
about the innovative ways

00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:19.442
to dispose of the waste.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.703
What are some of the thoughts, I guess,

00:24:22.723 --> 00:24:22.963
that are

00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.884
You know, going into that, you know,

00:24:25.983 --> 00:24:27.546
further use, obviously, right,

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:30.429
we use cow manure for

00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:33.111
certain fertilization.

00:24:33.852 --> 00:24:35.173
There's a lot of science, obviously,

00:24:35.213 --> 00:24:35.933
that goes into that.

00:24:35.973 --> 00:24:36.714
What are some of the things

00:24:36.734 --> 00:24:37.736
that perhaps you're either

00:24:37.816 --> 00:24:40.358
doing today or that you

00:24:40.398 --> 00:24:41.279
might be thinking about

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.303
doing in that regard of, you know,

00:24:44.323 --> 00:24:45.644
innovative ways to dispose

00:24:45.663 --> 00:24:47.226
of that and help the planet out?

00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:48.468
Absolutely.

00:24:48.528 --> 00:24:49.208
So again,

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:52.329
that is our consistent goal on

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:53.530
how we're going to dispose.

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.594
So composting pet waste, unfortunately,

00:24:56.673 --> 00:24:59.115
is a very, very long process.

00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:01.217
Pet waste has a ton of protein in it,

00:25:01.277 --> 00:25:02.698
and it cannot be utilized

00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:05.560
on any product without some

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.361
sort of treatment.

00:25:07.241 --> 00:25:09.683
But that's what it is today, right?

00:25:09.723 --> 00:25:10.463
We don't know what that's

00:25:10.503 --> 00:25:11.865
going to be like in the future.

00:25:11.924 --> 00:25:13.145
So we're constantly keeping

00:25:13.205 --> 00:25:13.987
a pulse on that.

00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:15.951
As a company now,

00:25:15.971 --> 00:25:16.931
we're using all

00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:19.172
eco-conscious and as many

00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:21.653
disposable biodegradable

00:25:21.752 --> 00:25:23.213
products as possible.

00:25:24.094 --> 00:25:26.035
So we are constantly,

00:25:26.095 --> 00:25:27.816
we want to be number one

00:25:27.836 --> 00:25:29.616
when it comes to choosing

00:25:30.257 --> 00:25:32.637
eco-conscious products in our business.

00:25:33.278 --> 00:25:35.700
But there are a lot of ways

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.500
that are currently being

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.001
tested on how to dispose of pet waste.

00:25:40.617 --> 00:25:41.179
Yeah, I can think,

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:43.240
if you've got that purpose,

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:45.622
that eco-minded purpose, eventually, yeah,

00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:46.603
you're going to come across

00:25:46.722 --> 00:25:47.824
a solution at some point.

00:25:47.844 --> 00:25:48.984
Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:49.965
Because you're continually

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:50.786
asking that question.

00:25:50.806 --> 00:25:51.326
All right,

00:25:51.366 --> 00:25:54.048
we've got another audience question here.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.530
Are there any community

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.751
programs or partnerships

00:25:57.791 --> 00:25:59.773
you've developed through your work?

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.290
Yes.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.570
I love that question.

00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:04.832
Always engaging within our community.

00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:07.792
So a lot of partnerships with, you know,

00:26:07.813 --> 00:26:10.452
the SPCA providing, you know,

00:26:10.613 --> 00:26:12.534
for dogs that are adopted,

00:26:13.013 --> 00:26:14.253
saved from the shelters,

00:26:14.453 --> 00:26:15.314
making sure that they're

00:26:15.334 --> 00:26:17.434
getting their first scoop free.

00:26:18.234 --> 00:26:20.516
And then community programs, cleaning up,

00:26:20.715 --> 00:26:21.875
especially our area, again,

00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:24.376
going back to being around the water.

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:26.156
So cleaning up

00:26:26.577 --> 00:26:27.659
the Bay,

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:30.259
making sure that we are connected with,

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:30.720
again,

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:32.201
our overall vision of having a clean,

00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:32.941
safe planet.

00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:36.502
Yeah, I love that.

00:26:36.522 --> 00:26:38.064
Thanks so much for that question, Bayani.

00:26:38.104 --> 00:26:39.365
We appreciate it.

00:26:39.684 --> 00:26:40.665
And to our listeners,

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.606
feel free to keep the questions coming.

00:26:43.047 --> 00:26:43.406
Yeah.

00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:44.007
I mean,

00:26:44.027 --> 00:26:45.327
it's a good point that we've talked

00:26:45.347 --> 00:26:46.608
about with a lot of franchise

00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:48.949
franchises is that trying to

00:26:48.989 --> 00:26:50.150
build that local community

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.289
connection in some way or

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:55.712
another um and uh you know

00:26:55.772 --> 00:26:56.973
there's a lot of ways they

00:26:57.653 --> 00:26:58.974
they try and go about it

00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:00.355
and you know some kind of

00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:01.276
view yourself as kind of

00:27:01.297 --> 00:27:03.018
the mayor the mayor of your

00:27:03.137 --> 00:27:05.038
your area right um so we

00:27:05.058 --> 00:27:07.059
have one more uh obvious

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:08.381
question here let's go to

00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:10.481
how do you stay grounded

00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:11.682
especially when demands of

00:27:11.782 --> 00:27:13.304
leadership get overwhelming

00:27:15.083 --> 00:27:16.423
That is an incredible question,

00:27:16.483 --> 00:27:19.625
especially for the stage of

00:27:19.685 --> 00:27:20.865
life that I'm in right now.

00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:22.146
Like I said,

00:27:22.366 --> 00:27:24.307
I am running this company as a startup.

00:27:24.327 --> 00:27:26.528
I have two young children, seven and two.

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:29.371
Pride and joy also of my life.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.712
And the number one,

00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:34.854
and I have said this time and time again,

00:27:34.894 --> 00:27:36.394
but it is having incredible

00:27:36.414 --> 00:27:38.996
mentors around you.

00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.517
So making sure that you have somebody

00:27:41.842 --> 00:27:42.061
Again,

00:27:42.082 --> 00:27:45.023
this has not been an easy job by any

00:27:45.084 --> 00:27:45.463
means.

00:27:45.604 --> 00:27:46.904
It has been exciting.

00:27:46.964 --> 00:27:50.428
And the amount of times that

00:27:50.488 --> 00:27:51.567
I'm laying in bed reading

00:27:51.587 --> 00:27:52.409
about pet waste is, you know,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.269
my husband's like,

00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.971
what are you reading now?

00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:56.332
Oh, did you know?

00:27:57.553 --> 00:27:58.814
Fun fact about pet waste.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:01.695
But having somebody, right, like I said,

00:28:01.796 --> 00:28:03.017
it can be challenging.

00:28:03.176 --> 00:28:05.557
And you can have an off day, right?

00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:08.200
You can have a day of

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:10.221
negative thoughts or failures even,

00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:10.481
right?

00:28:12.002 --> 00:28:14.084
And you can reflect on those,

00:28:14.104 --> 00:28:16.165
but you cannot sit there.

00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:17.307
And if you have a mentor or

00:28:17.366 --> 00:28:18.607
somebody that you look up

00:28:18.647 --> 00:28:21.190
to and is allowing you to

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.810
stay in that place for a long time,

00:28:24.092 --> 00:28:24.892
stay away from them.

00:28:25.452 --> 00:28:28.654
Find somebody else who is going to listen,

00:28:28.795 --> 00:28:29.675
provide feedback,

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:31.857
and give you a positive

00:28:32.198 --> 00:28:33.898
next step because you have

00:28:33.939 --> 00:28:34.859
to keep moving forward.

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:36.420
Yeah.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.519
And I always say, I mean,

00:28:37.601 --> 00:28:39.340
don't just have one mentor either.

00:28:39.441 --> 00:28:39.881
There,

00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:41.362
someone can be like your mentor in

00:28:41.382 --> 00:28:42.882
this certain particular

00:28:42.962 --> 00:28:44.583
area of your life where, you know,

00:28:44.643 --> 00:28:45.583
so you could have like the

00:28:45.604 --> 00:28:46.304
business mentor,

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:47.163
but you could also have

00:28:47.223 --> 00:28:48.904
someone that pushes you

00:28:48.984 --> 00:28:51.385
maybe athletically or, you know,

00:28:51.445 --> 00:28:51.965
physically,

00:28:52.026 --> 00:28:53.866
or another person who maybe pushes you,

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:54.926
you know, uh,

00:28:55.507 --> 00:28:56.847
on the social justice side or whatever,

00:28:56.887 --> 00:28:57.208
but yeah,

00:28:57.228 --> 00:28:59.009
you can have different mentors

00:28:59.209 --> 00:29:02.210
in your life that can help, uh,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.630
help you kind of level up

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.351
in each of these different areas.

00:29:05.451 --> 00:29:05.631
Yeah.

00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:07.968
And I think too,

00:29:08.209 --> 00:29:12.671
as we sort of go through our life, Steve,

00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:13.371
when we're younger,

00:29:13.431 --> 00:29:14.632
I sort of feel we look at

00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:18.054
mentors as those that we

00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:20.355
sort of wanted to emulate, right?

00:29:21.553 --> 00:29:24.714
And then now it almost seems

00:29:24.775 --> 00:29:27.336
as though the mentors in my

00:29:27.376 --> 00:29:29.057
life are really raising the

00:29:29.117 --> 00:29:30.417
level of consciousness.

00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:35.020
I don't know what has made that transition,

00:29:35.661 --> 00:29:37.122
if it's a change in goals

00:29:37.162 --> 00:29:38.083
or change in purpose,

00:29:38.123 --> 00:29:40.263
or if it's just at a

00:29:40.443 --> 00:29:41.625
different stage in life.

00:29:41.684 --> 00:29:43.665
But it's very interesting

00:29:44.066 --> 00:29:46.667
when you're able to have a mentor that

00:29:47.147 --> 00:29:47.867
don't necessarily want to

00:29:48.028 --> 00:29:48.909
act like them you don't

00:29:48.929 --> 00:29:50.068
necessarily want to you

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.029
know be like them uh but

00:29:52.089 --> 00:29:53.550
instead they you know help

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.971
you sort of gain

00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:57.573
perspective and you know

00:29:57.593 --> 00:29:59.294
think a little bit you know

00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:01.575
broader uh than than you

00:30:01.595 --> 00:30:03.895
know just one's self so you

00:30:03.915 --> 00:30:04.895
know julie going back to

00:30:04.935 --> 00:30:06.537
the point about the

00:30:06.676 --> 00:30:08.617
disposal of the waste I mean I think that

00:30:09.519 --> 00:30:10.221
That is going to be

00:30:11.682 --> 00:30:15.124
tremendous in part to the

00:30:15.203 --> 00:30:16.925
success of Cooper Scoopers.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:17.866
Because I would think that

00:30:18.406 --> 00:30:20.347
from the customer standpoint,

00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:24.352
if I was able to benefit

00:30:24.392 --> 00:30:26.573
the planet by partnering

00:30:26.593 --> 00:30:27.594
with an organization,

00:30:27.653 --> 00:30:29.536
perhaps like yourself, that is

00:30:31.888 --> 00:30:33.368
know disposing of waste in a

00:30:33.429 --> 00:30:35.069
responsible way versus like

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.250
say myself uh with our with

00:30:37.289 --> 00:30:39.150
our cat um you know just

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.029
putting it in like the

00:30:40.069 --> 00:30:42.411
normal trash I would I

00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:44.250
would much rather right

00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:46.092
feel it would give me the

00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:50.211
feeling um of of trying to

00:30:50.372 --> 00:30:51.512
you know benefit the

00:30:51.553 --> 00:30:52.492
community benefit the

00:30:52.512 --> 00:30:54.113
planet overall like I would

00:30:54.133 --> 00:30:55.532
almost be doing good in a

00:30:55.593 --> 00:30:58.253
way does that it does that

00:30:58.314 --> 00:30:59.334
sort of make sense and

00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:00.939
Absolutely.

00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:01.278
I mean,

00:31:01.439 --> 00:31:03.059
I don't know if you've driven past

00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:04.200
the landfill lately,

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:06.201
but apparently any open

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.041
space is now a landfill, right?

00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:09.422
Yeah.

00:31:09.602 --> 00:31:12.803
So anything we can do to eliminate that,

00:31:13.542 --> 00:31:14.103
and again,

00:31:14.644 --> 00:31:18.204
giving back as a parent is huge.

00:31:18.244 --> 00:31:19.325
So if we can connect with

00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:20.566
our families and provide

00:31:20.586 --> 00:31:22.185
that solution over the next

00:31:22.226 --> 00:31:24.126
five years when it comes to

00:31:24.146 --> 00:31:26.626
the responsible disposal of pet waste,

00:31:26.788 --> 00:31:28.208
that is, you know,

00:31:29.693 --> 00:31:31.994
a huge success in my eyes.

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:32.095
Yeah.

00:31:32.115 --> 00:31:32.194
Yeah.

00:31:32.214 --> 00:31:33.155
A lot of times like people,

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:35.556
they won't remember the, you know,

00:31:35.576 --> 00:31:36.656
features of a product or something,

00:31:36.676 --> 00:31:38.076
but they will remember our service.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:39.117
They will remember just how

00:31:39.137 --> 00:31:40.678
it made them feel a lot of times.

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:41.618
So this is kind of going to

00:31:41.638 --> 00:31:42.618
what Mike's saying is just

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:44.660
that feeling of, um,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.560
doing something socially responsible.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.721
We've got another guest or

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.922
another question for our

00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:51.001
guests from our audience.

00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:51.882
Uh,

00:31:51.923 --> 00:31:54.482
does community engagement play a role

00:31:54.542 --> 00:31:55.663
in your marketing efforts?

00:31:56.942 --> 00:31:58.364
Yes, absolutely.

00:31:58.943 --> 00:32:00.684
So I actually saw this

00:32:00.724 --> 00:32:03.026
morning on a marketing post

00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:07.146
about how important it is for IRL,

00:32:07.287 --> 00:32:10.388
which I'm young, but I'm not that hip.

00:32:10.848 --> 00:32:11.909
So I was like, what is IRL?

00:32:13.069 --> 00:32:15.570
In real life, events are.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.593
So that is absolutely very impactful.

00:32:21.393 --> 00:32:22.253
The more people that I've

00:32:22.314 --> 00:32:23.733
talked to in the last five

00:32:23.753 --> 00:32:25.335
months as I've taken on this position,

00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:27.987
that did not know that one,

00:32:28.007 --> 00:32:29.769
this is a service, but two,

00:32:30.388 --> 00:32:31.829
that leaving your pet waste

00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:34.172
in your backyard is very toxic.

00:32:34.412 --> 00:32:35.472
They have small kids.

00:32:35.492 --> 00:32:36.532
They're like, oh, you know,

00:32:36.553 --> 00:32:37.693
we'll clean it up later.

00:32:38.335 --> 00:32:39.836
That's being tracked into your home.

00:32:40.115 --> 00:32:43.898
So being able to be in IRL

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:46.420
events within the community

00:32:47.141 --> 00:32:49.201
is incredibly important for

00:32:49.222 --> 00:32:51.183
our franchisees, the education aspect,

00:32:51.203 --> 00:32:52.684
but also building that relationship.

00:32:53.821 --> 00:32:54.883
You want to like, know,

00:32:54.903 --> 00:32:56.463
and trust whoever you are

00:32:56.523 --> 00:32:57.325
purchasing from.

00:32:58.105 --> 00:32:58.605
Again,

00:32:58.744 --> 00:33:00.446
we double down on that trust by

00:33:00.487 --> 00:33:01.426
making sure that our

00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:02.907
technicians are Cooper

00:33:02.968 --> 00:33:05.150
certified and have a background check.

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:08.271
So that is number one for

00:33:08.311 --> 00:33:10.053
our franchisees as we are

00:33:10.472 --> 00:33:11.574
launching Cooper Scoopers

00:33:11.653 --> 00:33:12.334
across the nation.

00:33:12.354 --> 00:33:14.935
Julie,

00:33:15.236 --> 00:33:18.258
we asked this question to every

00:33:18.298 --> 00:33:19.578
guest in some sort of form.

00:33:20.378 --> 00:33:22.780
Do you think love belongs in business?

00:33:24.048 --> 00:33:25.127
Yes, absolutely.

00:33:26.128 --> 00:33:27.888
So it shows up for me

00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:30.329
specifically is respect as

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:32.490
I am launching this business.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.432
Curiosity to make sure that

00:33:34.451 --> 00:33:36.893
we are working as a team to

00:33:36.913 --> 00:33:38.472
find solutions and doing

00:33:38.492 --> 00:33:40.453
that in a loving manner.

00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:42.654
And then kindness towards

00:33:42.914 --> 00:33:44.855
our hopeful franchisees,

00:33:45.016 --> 00:33:48.196
our existing franchisees, and our teams.

00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:49.518
I think it's really important.

00:33:50.357 --> 00:33:51.798
Making sure that that love

00:33:51.978 --> 00:33:53.298
is contagious as well.

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:55.920
That's that fanatical fan

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.560
that we're creating for me

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.320
being a fanatical fan of

00:34:00.361 --> 00:34:01.601
Coopers Coopers all the way

00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:04.981
down to our pets being a fanatical fan,

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:07.021
being excited if they're in

00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:08.262
the backyard when a Coopers

00:34:08.342 --> 00:34:09.643
Coopers technician comes in.

00:34:10.762 --> 00:34:11.583
And people feel that.

00:34:11.603 --> 00:34:11.702

building systems and stuff,

00:34:20.304 --> 00:34:21.264
and so when you think of

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.659
building love into those for

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.780

can you think of an area to

00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:29.581
that like just instantly

00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:31.543
comes to mind uh the

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:32.682
communication to the pet

00:34:32.722 --> 00:34:35.083

00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:41.126
depending on if if the pet

00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:42.806
parent said treats are okay

00:34:43.367 --> 00:34:44.307
